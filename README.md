# MIFS
Modular Interconnecting Formwork System

The Modular Interconnecting Formwork System (MIFS) is a pilot project aimed at demonstrating a mix of compatible hard plastic, concrete and expanded polystyrene bricks and other forms as a construction aid, with a particular focus on reducing waste from conventional formwork systems, and in making earth building more economical.

At present this repository serves primarily as a mirror host for 3D models pertinent to the project. The project's main page can be found at Recyclopaedia; https://recyclopaedia.org.au/wiki/Modular_Interconnecting_Formwork_System and the other current mirror for CAD can be found on Thingiverse; https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5467974
